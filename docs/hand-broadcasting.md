# Broadcasting a Hand to RTMP

Open a connected screen and choose **Stream RTMP** in the web or native Apple
screen viewer. Enter the complete RTMP/RTMPS publish URL (including the stream
key), select a quality preset, and start. The destination is cleared from the
form after submission. Stop the stream with **Stop stream**; closing the preview
leaves it running. One broadcast can run per published Hand surface.

The publisher runs on the Hand. The account broker relays authenticated control
messages and sanitized status; it does not carry the outgoing media. RTMPS
verifies the destination certificate. Stream keys are not persisted in account
state, viewer state, or diagnostics. FFmpeg receives the destination locally;
local process inspection by the machine owner can see its arguments/environment.

## Quality

All presets use H.264, preserve aspect ratio, and never enlarge a smaller source.
Desktop system output is encoded as AAC at 48 kHz stereo. Microphones are never
selected as a fallback. Paired iPhone MJPEG streams carry video only.

| Preset | Maximum dimensions | Output rate | Video target | Keyframe interval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source | 3840 × 2160 | 60 fps | 24 Mbps | 2 seconds |
| 1080p | 1920 × 1080 | 60 fps | 8 Mbps | 2 seconds |
| 720p | 1280 × 720 | 60 fps | 4.5 Mbps | 2 seconds |
| Twitch | 1920 × 1080 | 60 fps | 6 Mbps | 2 seconds |
| X | 1920 × 1080 | 30 fps | 9 Mbps | 3 seconds |

Output rate is an encoder target; repeating frames cannot add detail or motion
to a slower capture source. A VM's physical desktop and a paired phone's existing
capture are the upper bound on source detail. Mac publishers use VideoToolbox;
Linux and Windows broadcast encoding currently uses software H.264. Achievable
resolution/rate depends on capture, CPU/GPU, and uplink capacity.

The native Mac paths use ScreenCaptureKit for system audio and broadcast video.
Rust Mac previews also use ScreenCaptureKit, avoiding AVFoundation screen-input
stalls observed during verification. Broadcast capture is separate from the
interactive preview's resolution and encoding settings. Encoded Rust VM sources
can feed a separate broadcast without opening a viewer on the host display.

## Requirements and lifecycle

- Install FFmpeg on desktop Hands (Windows can use the bundled FFmpeg). The
  native Mac app also finds its bundled helper or Homebrew FFmpeg.
- Linux needs an explicit PulseAudio playback monitor. Server/Cloudflare images
  now include PulseAudio and create a private playback sink when necessary.
- Screen/system-audio OS permission must already be granted to the Hand.
- Broadcasts reconnect after transient ingest failure with bounded retries and
  buffers. Stop/shutdown cancels and reaps encoder children. Viewer disconnection
  does not stop a broadcast; unsharing or loss of publisher authority does.
- Old Hands do not advertise broadcast support and do not show the stream button.

Publish the managed broker before updated Hand binaries, then the web/native UI.
The catalog adds optional `broadcast: true`. Viewers send `broadcast` messages
with a request ID, action (`start`, `stop`, `status`), and, only for start, URL and
preset. The broker supplies the exact viewer/surface identity and fences host
replacement, lease expiry, stale correlation and cross-host replies. Results
contain only fixed states/errors and bounded media metadata. `stopping` is a
valid transient state while native Apple encoders drain.

## Verification

`scripts/test-hand-rtmp.py` starts a private loopback ingest, runs the **actual
product publisher test**, records FLV, and uses FFprobe plus full FFmpeg decoding
to check codecs, dimensions, frame rate, monotonic timestamps, keyframe interval,
and ending audio/video skew. `--outage-after 3 --outage-duration 2` kills and
restarts ingest without restarting the publisher. `--tls` adds an ephemeral TLS
proxy and trusts its test CA only in the publisher subprocess.

Compile before starting the receiver (its admission timeout is bounded):

```sh
cargo test -p nanocodex2-bin --bin nanocodex2 screen_broadcast
python3 scripts/test-hand-rtmp.py --output target/rtmp-validation/rust \
  --min-duration 7 --min-fps 55 --require-audio -- \
  cargo test -p nanocodex2-bin --bin nanocodex2 \
  screen_broadcast::tests::local_rtmp_sink -- --ignored --nocapture

swift test --package-path apple/NanocodexRemote
python3 scripts/test-hand-rtmp.py --output target/rtmp-validation/apple \
  --min-duration 7 --min-fps 55 --require-audio -- \
  swift test --package-path apple/NanocodexRemote --skip-build \
  --filter RemoteBroadcastTests/testLoopbackPublisher

cd hands/remote && go test -race ./...
```

For Rust fixtures, `NANOCODEX_RTMP_TEST_SIZE=3840x2160` tests source quality,
`NANOCODEX_RTMP_TEST_PRESET=x` tests the platform preset, and
`NANOCODEX_RTMP_TEST_ENCODED=1` exercises the VM encoded-source path. Native
capture is opt-in via `screen_native::broadcast_live_tests::local_rtmp_native`.
Go's `TestBroadcastRTMP` uses the production supervisor with synthetic media;
`NANOCODEX_RTMP_TEST_DESKTOP=1` switches it to real Wayland/Pulse capture.
