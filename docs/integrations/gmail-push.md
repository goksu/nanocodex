# Continuous Gmail notifications

Gmail `users.watch` publishes mailbox history hints to Cloud Pub/Sub. The account
Worker exposes `POST /v1/gmail-push/{userId}/{connectionId}` and forwards only that
fixed path to egress. Egress verifies Google's RS256 signature, issuer, expiration,
audience, verified email and configured push service account. The mailbox Durable
Object checks the connected Gmail profile, stores a history cursor and durable
outbox, and renews the watch daily. OAuth tokens stay in UserConnectorBroker.

## Provisioning

Enable Gmail API and Pub/Sub in the **same Google project as the configured OAuth
client**. Create a topic and grant `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com`
`roles/pubsub.publisher` on that topic. Configure these non-secret egress variables:

- `GMAIL_PUSH_TOPIC`: `projects/example-project/topics/gmail-events`
- `GMAIL_PUSH_AUDIENCE`: the fixed audience configured on every push subscription,
  for example `https://app.example/v1/gmail-push`
- `GMAIL_PUSH_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: the dedicated push identity's service-account email
- `GMAIL_PUSH_SUBSCRIPTION`: exact `projects/.../subscriptions/...` allowlist
- `GMAIL_PUSH_OWNER_ID` and `GMAIL_PUSH_CONNECTION_ID`: the single enabled account
  and exact Google connection; all other mailbox configurations and push paths are denied

Create a wrapped, authenticated push subscription for the configured account/connection
on the topic. This receiver configuration admits one exact subscription. Its endpoint is
`https://app.example/v1/gmail-push/{userId}/{connectionId}`. Set its OIDC service
account and audience to the configured values. Grant Pub/Sub's service agent the
required `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken` permission on the push identity.
Keep payload unwrapping disabled. The identity should be dedicated to this
integration; requests from other identities are rejected. Events for other mailbox email addresses are acknowledged without waking an agent.
This first integration supports one mailbox per deployment. Multi-mailbox delivery
requires a separate routing design; changing these variables does not migrate watches.

Deploy the egress DO migration and managed wake receiver, then the account Worker.
This source change does not provision Google resources or deploy any Worker.
The existing Google connection needs Gmail read access; reconnect through normal
OAuth consent if it only grants other Workspace capabilities.

## Account API

The assistant tool `gmail_watch` exposes `enable`, `status`, and `disable` for the
current agent and exact `connection_id`. Enable also takes `email` and optional
`crm`; it routes through the same authenticated API below.

Use the authenticated account API to configure a mailbox's target agent:

```
PUT /v1/agents/{agentId}/gmail-push/{connectionId}
GET /v1/agents/{agentId}/gmail-push/{connectionId}
DELETE /v1/agents/{agentId}/gmail-push/{connectionId}
```

The agent must belong to the authenticated account. Connect grants cannot create
these watches. PUT takes a JSON body `{"email":"mailbox@example.com"}`. Add
`"crm":true` to explicitly enable CRM email interactions. This reads only bounded
inbox message metadata and appends sourced notes to an existing, unambiguous exact
CRM email identity. It creates no contacts and never edits manual notes or sends mail.
Each delivery processes at most five messages; durable receipts let broker retries
continue through unmatched senders without duplicating notes. Resync hints do not
trigger an inbox backfill. CRM defaults off; disable before changing the opt-in.
The server verifies
that address against the exact connection's Gmail profile. One mailbox has one target agent; disable before changing it. Enable only
after the Pub/Sub subscription exists, then send a test message and inspect status
and the resulting TODO/CRM updates before disabling the old five-minute polling cron.
The integration does not automatically remove existing account schedules.

With CRM enabled, bounded metadata reads attach dated, sourced email interactions
to existing contacts matched by exact sender address. They do not create a contact
for every sender, read attachments, overwrite manual notes, or send replies. A
durable receipt prevents duplicate notes when a delivery is replayed. Expired
Gmail history is reported as a gap; it does not trigger an unbounded inbox import.

The provisioning helper defaults to an offline dry run:

```sh
node scripts/gmail-push-setup.mjs --project example-project \
  --gmail-oauth-project example-project \
  --push-endpoint https://app.example/v1/gmail-push/OWNER/CONNECTION
```

Inspect its output before using `--apply`. It provisions Google resources only;
configure the account API separately.

## Delivery and recovery

Push acknowledgment means the history target is durable, not that background processing
finished. Duplicate and older history hints do not create duplicate work. Alarms
page through Gmail history and persist an outbox before delivering an event.
Unavailable dependencies cause bounded retry with the same event ID and frozen
content. The managed receiver records completed deliveries independently of chat
turns; concurrent delivery and replay do not repeat completed work. Active user
conversations do not block background mail processing.

Work per alarm and the message IDs included in each event are bounded. Renewal
catches up from the existing cursor; it never replaces an unprocessed cursor with
the watch result. An hourly backend-only history check recovers missed pushes.
Each alarm delivers at most one event with up to five new message IDs; remaining
chunks stay durable for subsequent processing. An expired history cursor produces
an explicit resynchronization event rather than silently claiming all intervening
changes were delivered.

Only newly added INBOX messages are processed. Draft, sent-only and label-only
changes do not trigger processing. Self-addressed mail delivered to INBOX remains
eligible. The backend resolves message IDs through the selected Gmail connection
and includes message headers and decoded body text in the background event.
Gmail events never submit a chat turn, append notification JSON to a conversation,
or start a conversation to summarize mail. Enabled TODO classification and
explicitly opted-in CRM imports run in the background.
The backend prefers the plain-text MIME alternative and converts HTML-only
mail to inert text. Selected text bodies stored separately by Gmail are resolved
through the same connection. File contents are not downloaded. Resolution is
bounded: an event fits within 32 KiB, a single message snapshot is at most 16,000
serialized UTF-8 bytes, and multi-message events share the available budget.
Missing messages, unavailable content, and truncation are explicit in the payload.

The resolved envelope is persisted before its first delivery attempt, so an
ambiguous response reuses identical content. Outboxes created
before this feature retain their original identifier-only input for replay safety.
Email content remains untrusted context. Receiving an event does not authorize sending email or other
external actions; existing explicit user authorization is still required.
Disabling stops local delivery immediately and attempts `users.stop`; inspect the
returned `watchStopped` value. Delete the associated Pub/Sub subscription when
retiring a mailbox. Gmail's watch is shared per mailbox/project, so another client
using the same OAuth project can replace or stop it.

See Google's [Gmail push guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/guides/push)
and [authenticated Pub/Sub push documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/authenticate-push-subscriptions).

## Current scope

This integration delivers durable mailbox events without creating chat turns.
The configured TODO decision producer can classify messages and propose reply
items; CRM imports require the watch's explicit opt-in. Neither processing path
sends email. A successful watch configuration or accepted event is not evidence
that an email response was sent, nor does it guarantee a remote push notification.
