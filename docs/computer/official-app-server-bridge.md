# Managed official macOS CUA host

On macOS, `computer setup` installs an attested subset of OpenAI's signed release
and a Nanocodex transport launcher. The subset contains only the official CLI,
CUA Node runtime, browser bridge, and the minimum bundle signature metadata. It
excludes the Electron application shell. The launcher starts the official app server
and CUA provider **without launching the ChatGPT/Codex desktop GUI**. The upstream
native computer-use helper can run in the background; its OS permissions still
apply. Compatibility is capability-checked instead of pinned to a GUI build.

## Permission handling

The official app server advertises MCP form support and applies the user's existing
Codex permission policy. Under full-access authority, codex-rs can accept standard
empty-form confirmations without a GUI. Nanocodex does not inject an approval,
change sandbox or approval settings, add a permission dialog, or cache consent.
The provider still checks app policy before issuing its confirmation request.

If upstream policy requires interactive input, the managed headless bridge declines
that unresolved request for its own CUA thread. It never accepts it on the user's
behalf, answers another client's requests, or opens an app to ask. Consequently,
headless operation does not override restricted profiles, organization policy,
macOS access controls, or upstream operations that require interactive input.

## Installation and lifecycle

The signed component set is cached under `runtimes/openai-cua/versions`. Nanocodex's own
launcher and bridge modules live separately under `hosts/<content-hash>`.
`provider.json` selects an immutable launcher. Updating Nanocodex generates a new
host directory while reusing the verified bundle. Existing processes retain their
selected generation; restart a running Hand to pick up the new launcher. A TUI
reload alone does not restart the shared Hand. Modified assets and invalid bundle
signatures fail validation.

The dependency-free supervisor in `openai-cua-native-host.mjs` uses the bundled
Node, official CLI, and direct CUA provider. It never patches the signed bundle,
copies credentials, or changes normal Codex configuration. Official programs use
the existing Codex home and sign-in state.

A private Unix socket and `shlock` singleton identify the bundle, launcher, state
directory, and effective Codex home. The server listens on an OS-selected loopback
port; the supervisor waits for its `/readyz` response before exposing a lease.
Other configured MCP servers are disabled only in this dedicated server through
temporary CLI overrides. Only names and transport kinds are retained from CLI
metadata; their saved settings remain unchanged.

Catalog discovery creates no thread. The first tool call creates a separate
**ephemeral** official thread without injecting history or invoking a model.
There is no GUI attachment or GUI-readiness wait. Closing a bridge releases its
lease; after the final lease the supervisor stops its owned server after 60 seconds
idle, with 120 seconds startup grace. Server death fails pending work. Calls are
never replayed. Closing a transport or resetting a session does not prove that
upstream/native input stopped; effects remain uncertain and must not be replayed.

## Transport

`openai-cua-app-server.mjs` forwards MCP stdio calls to the official app server.
Provider definitions, schemas, arguments, metadata, results, images, and structured
content are preserved. Catalog entries are sorted only for stable discovery.
Authentic nested caller metadata is preserved; top-level thread routing identifies
the bridge's own thread. App-server errors retain their code, message, and data.

Calls within one bridge are ordered. Caller cancellation, startup timeout, EOF,
and connection loss close only that connection. A new MCP process gets a fresh
thread. The outer Nanocodex MCP adapter does not need to advertise elicitation:
the official app server owns that protocol with the provider.

Both standalone and managed bridges delegate tool execution timeouts to the
official app server and provider. The bridge does not parse `arguments.timeout_ms`
or put a second wall timer around forwarded tool calls. The official app server
owns its configured MCP tool timeout
([upstream default: 300 seconds](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/1427825c4044d48b513c7d4ea32b84e58806a188/codex-rs/codex-mcp/src/rmcp_client.rs#L104));
[direct tool calls](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/1427825c4044d48b513c7d4ea32b84e58806a188/codex-rs/core/src/codex_thread.rs#L965)
supply no requested timeout override. An unresponsive provider is governed
by that upstream timeout or genuine caller cancellation. The bridge's trusted
`NANOCODEX_CUA_APP_SERVER_TIMEOUT_MS` still bounds connection, initialization,
catalog discovery, and thread startup. Provider arguments cannot extend or disable
those deadlines. The standalone bridge defaults to 300 seconds for these
transport requests. The managed host supplies its trusted 120-second timeout;
its metadata discovery, endpoint discovery, readiness checks, and upstream MCP
startup retain their existing 120-second limits. These are separate phase limits,
not one cumulative tool-call budget. The outer Rust MCP adapter additionally
bounds each provider process startup (initialization plus full catalog discovery)
to a trusted cumulative 120 seconds, both at attachment discovery and when a
conversation starts its own process. This deadline ends before tool execution.

The outer Nanocodex adapter also forwards `timeout_ms` unchanged and awaits the
provider result. Queueing and provider startup do not consume that argument's
execution budget. If the caller cancels or transport fails, the affected session
requires a successful explicit `js_reset` and fresh observation before continuing. Neither
transport teardown nor reset proves that earlier native input has stopped. Never
replay input whose effects are uncertain.

The transport's existing standalone GUI integration remains optional for operators
who explicitly connect it to an existing official server and set
`NANOCODEX_CUA_APP_SERVER_OPEN_GUI=1`. The managed default does not use that path.
Windows uses its separate official-provider transport.

## Verification

```sh
node --test scripts/tests/openai-cua-{app-server,gui-readiness,native-host}.test.mjs
node --test js/nanocodex-computer/test/*.test.mjs
cargo test -p nanocodex-computer
NANOCODEX_TEST_CODEX_BIN=/absolute/path/to/official/codex \
  node --test scripts/tests/openai-cua-headless-upstream.test.mjs
```

Focused tests cover headless thread creation, no GUI attachment, unchanged policy
and payloads, unresolved-request isolation, cancellation, leases, and child failure.
The opt-in real-binary test uses an isolated temporary home and synthetic provider
to verify that full-access policy accepts confirmations while read-only policy
declines them, without client approval requests. It also verifies that a direct
tool call with `timeout_ms: 1` receives an unchanged delayed synthetic result.
Virtual-time tests verify late success and provider errors, no replay, and bounded
startup. Native app checks must additionally establish that the signed helper
starts with the desktop GUI closed; a synthetic MCP result alone is not that proof.
