### Rust API migration

Read the [0.5 → 0.6 Rust API changelog and migration guide](https://github.com/gakonst/nanocodex/blob/v0.6.0/docs/MIGRATING_0_6.md) before upgrading.

- **Breaking:** turn usage and snapshots are optional; session IDs are strings; prompt wrappers now target `PromptRequest`.
- **Breaking:** `hosted` tool APIs move to `embedded`; Code Mode execution/wait returns `Result`; protocol literals gain asynchronous fields.
- **Behavior:** default model/reasoning changes to Astra/low; resumed sessions use current instructions and tools; billing-uncertainty metrics and generic MCP resource helpers are removed.
- **Optional SDK layers:** durable execution with caller-owned storage, reusable subagent orchestration, and a managed backend. Browser, egress, VM, and voice leave experimental paths; computer and evals retain the label.

### Bug Fixes

- [durability] Checkpoint recovered cancellations ([#301](https://github.com/gakonst/nanocodex/issues/301))
- [durability] Emit terminals only after durable settlement
- [durability] Checkpoint current execution and retire settled effects
- [apple] Preserve repository tree in native playtest update
- [apple] Preserve reading position and playtest navigation edge cases
- [durability] Stream large checkpoints within the Worker memory budget
- [durability] Recover from authoritative operation settlement
- [durability] Recover with retained model requests
- [managed] Retain steering and sandbox work across retries
- [durability] Replay completed tool outputs exactly
- [ci] Satisfy durability const lints
- [durability] Remove billing uncertainty state
- [durability] Settle uncertain effects safely
- [durability] Harden adversarial store boundaries
- [managed] Preserve exact durable dispatch state

### Documentation
