# nanocodex-durability

`nanocodex-durability` is the portable durable-execution boundary used by
Nanocodex agents. Rust owns a small execution head, immutable payload records, its optimistic
revision protocol, deduplication, checkpoint selection, and every recovery
decision. Hosts publish records and their head in one transaction. There is no event-log
replay during recovery.

See [the end-to-end durability model and correctness review](../../docs/DURABILITY.md)
for the Rust state machine, Agent/WASM/application consumption, and crash
matrix.

This crate is an optional layer over `nanocodex-agent`: durability depends on
the agent, never the reverse. It implements the agent's neutral execution
policy seam at prompt admission, model calls, tool calls, and committed
session boundaries.

The pieces compose progressively; none of the lower layers imports this crate:

```text
nanocodex-oai-api <- nanocodex-tools <- nanocodex-agent
                                             ^
                                             |
                                  nanocodex-durability
```

Construct only the layer an application needs, or attach durable state after the
OpenAI client and tool registry have been composed into an agent:

```rust,ignore
use nanocodex_agent::{Nanocodex, OpenAi, PromptRequest};
use nanocodex_durability::{DurableAgentExt, DurableSession, MemoryStore};
use nanocodex_tools::Tools;

let openai = OpenAi::new(std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY")?)?;
let tools = Tools::builder().without_defaults().build()?;

let store = MemoryStore::new()?;
let state = DurableSession::open(store, "agent-123").await?;
let (agent, events) = Nanocodex::builder(openai)
    .tools(tools)
    .durability(state)
    .await?
    .build()?;

// Omit request_id() to let the durable agent generate one during admission.
let turn = agent
    .prompt(PromptRequest::new("hello").request_id("request-7"))
    .await?;
assert_eq!(turn.request_id(), Some("request-7"));
```

Durability is local to the explicitly configured agent. Spawned subagents and
all descendants are ephemeral: they receive no durable owner, execution journal,
or inherited rollout recorder. Their live state ends with the parent runtime.

Without `.durability(...)`, the same builder is an ordinary non-durable agent.
An OpenAI-only consumer can stop at `OpenAi::instructions(...).build()`, and a
tools-only consumer can stop at `Tools::builder().build()`. A caller that owns
either lower-level lifecycle can use `DurableSession` directly, choose its own
operation and step IDs, and persist its own typed checkpoints and outputs. The
automatic model/tool/checkpoint integration is specifically the
`DurableAgentExt` adapter.

The crate includes an in-memory store on every target and optional native
SQLite and Postgres stores. JavaScript runtimes implement the same small store
contract through the Nanocodex WASM host bridge.

Operations are durable accepted units of work. Steps cover every external
effect inside an operation: model calls, warmup, automatic compaction, and
tools. Beginning a step returns `Execute` when no output is committed or
`Replay(output)` when one is. An unfinished step executes again after recovery.
This deliberately permits duplicate provider billing and duplicate external
tool effects. Standalone compaction follows the same rule: a committed
checkpoint replays, while an unfinished transform runs again.

An active turn retains one current conversation, its execution phase and counters,
and only the effects in the current model/tool batch. Advancing to the next batch
atomically replaces that conversation and removes the settled effects. Recovery
starts at this position; it does not rerun earlier model/tool batches or retain
copies of their requests. Warmup and pre-turn compaction have explicit phases so
an interruption cannot repeat prompt preparation or lose its original context.
The Rust adapter owns these boundaries; hosts do not manage pruning or recovery.
Format 4 replaces inline payloads and compressed whole-state snapshots with immutable records.

Completed tool outputs replay exactly without consulting the recovered runtime's
current tool catalog. Tool availability matters only when an unfinished step
must execute. Capabilities represented by a tool result, such as spawned-agent
identity, own their persistence and reconnection semantics outside generic step
replay. A durability-attached agent passes the same lifecycle to every clean
descendant. Each child uses its own stable session ID as its state ID and owns
an independent fence, operation journal, and checkpoint. Forking a durable
checkpoint remains unsupported because a fork is not a clean state.

This persists agent execution, not a higher-level task-tree registry. An
orchestrator that assigns separate tree-local IDs, mailboxes, roles, or status
must persist that topology independently and map those IDs to agent session
IDs when it needs cold tree reconstruction.

The execution head contains references, active phase, counters, and a bounded
receipt tail. SHA-256 addressed records hold exact payloads in chunks of at most
256,000 UTF-8 bytes. Persistent context pages reference 64 messages each; new
boundaries write new messages and changed pages. Cold recovery loads only the
current context and active effects, in batches of at most 16 records. Opening a
session for admission or status does not hydrate conversation bodies.

Resident execution memory scales with current model context, active tool working
memory, and bounded storage buffers. Total historical storage grows with work.
There is no step count or duration cap. A tool that itself allocates an arbitrary
amount of memory still needs a host able to run it. Completed code cells release
their origin-call mappings; suspended cells retain only their live mappings.

The runtime follows the same ownership model as the agent SDK. A
`DurableSession` is a cheap channel handle; one spawned task owns its reducer,
live claims, revision, and owner token. One separate task serializes access to
the caller-owned store so independent agent state drivers can address distinct
state IDs even when the backend itself is not cloneable. There is no shared
mutable reducer or `Arc<Mutex<Connection>>` contract.

```rust
use nanocodex_durability::{Admission, DurableSession, MemoryStore};

# async fn example() -> nanocodex_durability::Result<()> {
let store = MemoryStore::new()?;
let state = DurableSession::open(store.clone(), "agent-123").await?;

match state.admit_typed::<_, String, String>("request-7", &"hello").await? {
    Admission::Accepted | Admission::Pending => {
        state.begin_attempt("request-7").await?;
        state.complete("request-7", &"checkpoint", &"answer").await?;
    }
    Admission::Completed { checkpoint, output } => {
        assert_eq!((checkpoint, output), ("checkpoint".to_owned(), "answer".to_owned()));
    }
    Admission::Failed { checkpoint, error } => {
        assert_eq!((checkpoint, error), ("checkpoint".to_owned(), "provider rejected input".to_owned()));
    }
    Admission::Cancelled => {}
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

Enable `sqlite` and open `SqliteStore` for a directly owned native connection.
Enable `postgres` and pass a driven `tokio_postgres::Client` to
`PostgresStore::new`. Both implement the exact same `StateStore` contract.

The logical host contract has three operations:

- `acquire(state_id, owner_id)` atomically advances the persisted owner
  fence and returns that token with one coherent current-state value.
- `read_record(state_id, key)` returns one immutable body; `read_records` batches
  up to 16 reads when the backend supports it.
- `replace(state_id, owner_token, expected_revision, payload, records)` checks
  authority before revision and publishes immutable records with their new head
  in one transaction. A head can never reference a partially committed batch.

Hosts do not deserialize state, snapshots, model outputs, or tool results.
Rust owns those types and all recovery decisions.

Only a definite `NotCommitted` replacement may be retried on the same owner.
`Fenced`, revision `Conflict`, and unconfirmed `Backend` failures require a fresh
owner acquisition and loading the complete current state before deciding what
ran.

Each external effect follows an intent/effect/settlement boundary. A start
commits `effect_pending`; settlement atomically replaces it with `completed`
and the exact output. A crash before settlement executes the effect again with
the same stable identity and input. A crash after settlement replays the output
without invoking the effect again. Agent model calls, warmups, and compactions
reconstruct their requests from that retained input, so changed instructions,
tool catalogs, or environment context cannot redefine an interrupted call.
New calls use the current runtime; live tool authorization and owner fencing
still apply. There is no per-effect retry policy or uncertainty state. Operation
terminals atomically carry their checkpoint and replay receipt.

Unlike a store that stages an output separately from source-ordered transcript
placement, this store owns one opaque total state. A second materialization
write would add latency without adding a recovery boundary.
