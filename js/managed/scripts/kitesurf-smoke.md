# Local Kitesurf smoke

From `js/managed`, with Node 22, dependencies installed, and Wrangler authenticated with Browser Run access:

```sh
corepack pnpm exec wrangler dev --config scripts/wrangler.kitesurf-smoke.jsonc --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8793
```

In another terminal:

```sh
curl --fail-with-body --max-time 100 -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8793/smoke
```

The local Durable Object uses the real remote `BROWSER` binding, local `LOADER`, and the upstream Agents browser runtime through `createManagedBrowserRuntime`. Kitesurf receives the original BROWSER binding and the upstream tool schema, description, CDP commands and results without custom filtering or sanitization. The smoke asserts completed CDP navigation to example.com and the Example Domain title and HTML. With host Vault resolvers configured, it also asserts that only browser_execute is exposed and secure input is rejected before any login lookup. The response contains only the bounded evidence fields. Browser connections close in `finally`. Stop Wrangler with Ctrl-C afterward. This config is for ephemeral local development; do not deploy it.
